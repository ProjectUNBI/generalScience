    String html = '<h3> Motion</h3> <p>*When a body changes its position with respect to something else as time goes on, we say the body is  in  motion.</p> <p>*There are two types of motion- translational(linear) and rotational (spin).</p> <p>*The motion of a car on a road is translational whereas the motion of a top, spinning on its axis is rotational.</p> <h3> Speed</h3> <p>*It is a scalar form of velocity and is defined as the distance travelled irrespective of direction in one second.</p> <p>*            Speed = distance travelled/Time required</p> <p>*SI unit of speed is meters per second (m/s).</p> <h3> Velocity</h3> <p><br />*The distance covered by an object in a specified direction in unit time interval is called velocity.</p> <p>*The SI unit of velocity is m/s.</p> <p>*Velocity is a vector quantity.</p> <h3> Acceleration</h3> <p>*The velocity of a body changes due to change in its speed or director, both. The rate of change of the  velocity of a body is called its acceleration.</p> <p><br />*         Acceleration = change in velocity/time</p> <p>*Negative acceleration is known as retardation. It indicates that the velocity of the object is decreasing with respect to time.</p> <p>*Acceleration is uniform when neither its direction nor magnitude changes with respect to time.</p> <h3> Acceleration Due to Gravity</h3> <p>*When a body falls freely, then the increase in velocity per second is called acceleration due to gravity.   It is represented by g.</p> <p><br />*       g = GMe/Re^2</p> <p>*where G = Universal Gravitational Constant Me = Mass of Earth Re = Radius of the Earth</p> <p><br />*Value of g depends upon the radius of the earth as g cc -1.<br />*Value of g is maximum at poles and minimum at equator.</p> <h3> Equations of Motion</h3> <p><br />** 1. V = u + at    2. S = ut + 1/2 at^2     3.  V^2 = u^2 + 2as</p> <p><br />*  where u is initial velocity</p> <p>    V is final velocity</p> <p>    t is time</p> <p>    a is acceleration</p> <p>    s is distance</p> <h2> Force</h2> <h3> Gravitational Force</h3> <p>*It is the force of attraction between two masses.</p> <p>*The gravitational force exists between all bodies, even between two apples lying on a table.</p> <p>*It is gravitational force that holds the moon in its orbit round the earth and the earth in its orbit round the sun.</p> <p>*Newton.\'s Law or Universal Gravitation states that every particle in the universe attracts every other    particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and Inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.</p> <p>*In equation form, the gravitational force</p> <p>*       F = G(m1,m2/r^2)<br />*where r is the distance between two particles of masses in, and in) and the universal gravitational constant.</p> <p>*The value of 0 is 6.67 x 10 " SI units.</p> <h3> Centripetal Force</h3> <p>*The force acting towards the centre on a particle executing uniform circular motion is called centripetal force and is given by</p> <p>*   F = mv^2/r<br />     <br />*where m = Mass of the object v = Speed r = Radius of the Circular Path</p> <p>*In case of the moon, gravitational force between the earth and the moon acts as the centripetal force.</p> <p>*When a stone tied at one end of a string is whirled in a circle, the pull in the string provides the centripetal force.</p> <p>*Without centripetal force there can be no circular motion.</p> <p>*Centripetal force always acts on the particle performing circular motion.</p> <h3> Centrifugal Force</h3> <p>*The pseudo force that balances the centripetal force in uniform circular motion is called centrifugal force.</p> <p>*Centrifugal force is directed away from the centre along the radius.</p> <p>*The centrifugal force is zero exactly at the poles and maximum at the equator.</p> <h2> Weight</h2> <p>*The weight of a body is the force with which the earth attracts the body towards its centre.</p> <p>*The weight of a body should not be confused with its mass, which is a measure of the quantity of matter contained in it. When we say that a person weighs 60 kg, we are actually describing his mass  and not weight.</p> <p>*The mass of a body is a constant quantity whereas its weight varies slightly from place -to-place on    the earth.</p> <p>*The weight of a body is maximum at the poles and minimum at the equator. This variation in weight    is due to:</p> <p> 1. the shape of the earth.</p> <p> 2. the rotation of the earth about its axis.</p> <p>*The weight of an object is less at high elevations than at sea level.</p> <p>*At the centre of the earth, the weight of a body would be zero.</p> <p>*The weight of a body can also be expressed in terms of the acceleration due to gravity (g). The weight (w) of a body of mass m is given by the product of m and g, i.e.,</p> <p>               w = mg</p> <p>*On the surface of the moon the value of the acceleration due to gravity is nearly one -sixth of that on  earth and, therefore, an object on the moon would weigh only one -sixth its weight on the earth.  The mass of an object on the moon would be the same as on earth.</p> <p>*The weight of a body would be more if the earth stopped rotating. Conversely, if the speed of rotation  were higher, the weight would be lesser.</p> <p>*A person weighs more in a lift, which is accelerating upward.</p> <p>*An astronaut feels weightlessness in a spaceship because he is not pushing against anything.</p> <h2>Friction</h2> <p>*Friction is the force which opposes the relative motion of two surfaces in contact.</p> <p>*It is friction between the ground and the soles of our shoes that makes walking possible and it is lack  of friction that makes our feet slip on highly polished surfaces.</p> <p>*The force of friction that acts when a body is moving (sliding) on a<br />  surface is called sliding friction.</p> <p>*When a cylindrical or spherical body rolls over a surface, the force opposing the motion is called rolling friction. For the same pair of materials rolling friction is much smaller than sliding friction.</p> <p><br />*Friction in machines wastes energy and also causes wear and tear. This friction is reduced by using      (I) lubricants, and (2) ball bearings.</p> <p>*Roiling friction is always lesser than the sliding friction and hence it is easier to move a heavy object    on rollers rather than to slide it.</p> <p>*This property can be attributed to the fact that in case of rolling friction, the area of contact between    the two surfaces is far less.</p> <h2> NEWTON.\'S LAW OF MOTION</h2> <h3> FIRST LAW</h3> <p>*Every object continues in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line if no net force acts upon it. It is also known as <strong>law of inertia</strong>.</p> <p>*Examples: 1. An unwary passenger in a fast-moving bus falls forward when it stops suddenly. This happens because the feet of the passenger come to rest suddenly whereas his body continues to be in motion.</p> <p>*2. A person getting down from a moving bus has to run some distance, in the direction of the bus, before stopping. If he does not run he is bound to fall because his feet come to rest whereas his body continues to be in motion.</p> <h3>Momentum</h3> <p>*The momentum of a body is defined as the product of its mass and velocity.</p> <h3>SECOND LAW</h3> <p>*This law states that "the rate of changeof momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force and takes place in the direction of the force.</p> <p>*If we express force (F) in Newtons, mass (m) in kilograms and acceleration (a) in metres per second    squared, we can write the second law as</p> <p>*      F = ma</p> <p><br />*In travelling the same distance, a car consumes more fuel on a crowded road than on a free road.This happens because the car has to stop and start quite often on a crowded road. The repeated acceleration requires a force (second law), which ultimately comes from the fuel. On a free the car runs at almost uniform speed requiring fewer accelerations hence less fuel consumption.</p> <h3>THIRD LAW</h3> <p>*This law states that "to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction:, The statement means    that if body A exerts a force on body B, then B exerts an equal and opposite force on A along the same line of action.</p> <p>*When a bullet is fired from a gun, equal and opposite forces are exerted on the bullet and the gun.</p> <p>*A rocket contains solid chemicals which burn to produce a high velocity blast of hot gases. Space rockets have liquid fuel together with a supply of liquid oxygen to enable the fuel to burn. In either case, the large force created by chemical reaction propels out hot gases through the tall nozzle with a very high velocity. The reaction to this force propels the rocket forward.</p> <p>*The engine in a jet aeroplane works on the same principle as a rocket but there is a difference in the method of obtaining the high velocity gas jet.</p> <p>*The fuel used in a jet engine in Kerosene (paraffin).</p> <h2> IMPULSE</h2> <p>*If a force acts on a body for a very short time, then the product of force and time is called the impulse.</p> <p>*     Impulse = Change in momentum = Force x Time</p> <p><br /><strong>Application of Impulse</strong></p> <p>I. A cricket player draws his hand back while catching.</p> <p>2. A person jumping on hard cement floor receives more injuries than a person jumping on muddy or sandy floor.</p>';
